## Password Validator

In this project, you are going to implement a program that validates a password entered by a user.

## Task & Flow
The program starts by asking the user to enter a password that suits the following criteria:
- Length should be between 9 and 12 characters
- Password has at least 3 special characters
- Password has at least 5 normal characters (letters)

You may then use a loop to check password characters one at a time.
